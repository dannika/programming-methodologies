 * Class: CS106A
 * Section Leader: Jacob Hoffman
 * 
 * This program plays the Yahtzee game. There are five dice and one to four players. A round
 * of the game consists of each player taking a turn. On each turn, a player rolls the five 
 * dice with the hope of getting them into a configuration that corresponds to one of 13 
 * categories (see the following section). If the first roll doesnâ€™t get there, the player 
 * may choose to roll any or all of the dice again. If the second roll is still unsuccessful,
 * the player may roll any or all of the dice once more. By the end of the third roll, 
 * however, the player must assign the final dice configuration to one of the thirteen 
 * categories on the scorecard. If the dice configuration meets the criteria for that 
 * category, the player receives the appropriate score for that category; otherwise the 
 * score for that category is 0. Since there are thirteen categories and each category is 
 * used exactly once, a game consists of thirteen rounds. After the thirteenth round, all 
 * players will have received scores for all categories. The player with the total highest 
 * score is declared the winner.
 * 
 * The categories of dice configurations are scored as followed:
 * 
 * (1 - 6) Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes. Any dice configuration is valid for these
 * categories. The score is equal to the sum of all of the respective numbers showing on the
 * dice, which is 0 if there are none showing.
 * 
 * (7) Three of a Kind. At least three of the dice must show the same value. The score is 
 * equal to the sum of all of the values showing on the dice.
 * 
 * (8) Four of a Kind. At least four of the dice must show the same value. The score is equal
 * to the sum of all of the values showing on the dice.
 * 
 * (9) Full House. The dice must show three of one value and two of another. The score is
 * 25 points.
 * 
 * (10) Small Straight. The dice must contain at least four consecutive values. The score is
 * 30 points.
 * 
 * (11) Large Straight. The dice must contain five consecutive values. The score is 40 points.
 * 
 * (12) Yahtzee! All of the dice must show the same value. The score is 50 points.
 * 
 * (13) Chance. Any dice configuration is valid for this category. The score is equal to 
 * the sum of all of the values showing on the dice.
